# Distraction-Blocker
Chrome-Extensions to block most of the noise from social networks (Youtube, Instagram, Twitter). 

## Purpose of project
This repository is filled with chrome extensions I developed as I couldn't find any online in order to reduce my regretted time on social media whilst on my computer.
Rather than not using social media at all, this is to increase my controlling the noise (subjective of course) on platforms like Youtube, Instagram and Twitter.

### Primary Goal
- Improving Javascript and Web Designing in general through this project-based approach.
- Learning Typescript

### Secondary Goal
- Learn about Search Algorithms in different platforms and Search in general
- Page Rank algorithm etc.



## Extensions within the Repo
Youtube Extensions:
1. Create settings page: options to get rid of shorts, other noisy UI interfaces
2. Block titles with certain words (settings list)
3. Get rid of Music, playlist etc...

Instagram Extensions:
1. Get rid of everything except for 'messages'
2. Block url for reels
3. 

Twitter Extensions: Building a free version of the TweetDeck -> Maximize the platform for learning as opposed to drama and politics
1. Get rid of For you and Following pages.
2. Add Settings for this.

Ultimate Goal:
1. Merge this extensions into one extension that I can use whenever on a social network.

Future project goals:
- Train an AI model to get rid of click-baity thumbnails ("Things I wish I knew", "Tier list", )
- Automate this process of getting rid of interfaces with AI so I don't have to manually go into the JS, HTML, CSS etc.
